# 🎧 Spotify Hybrid Recommender System

A full-stack hybrid recommender system that combines **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** to suggest songs aligned with user preferences. Built with Python and Streamlit, integrated with AWS for scalable deployment and dynamic data access.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎵 **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user listening history and cosine similarity on sparse matrices.
- 🧠 **Content-Based Filtering**: Leverages metadata like artist, genre, tempo, and more.
- 🔄 **Hybrid Mode**: Combines both methods for balanced and accurate recommendations.
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployment** — Deployed on Streamlit Cloud and AWS EC2 using a CI/CD pipeline.

## 🔍 Datasets Used
	•	User Listening History.csv: User-song interaction dataset.
	•	collab_filtered_data.csv: Final dataset for content-based filtering.
	•	transformed_data.npz: Sparse matrix from collaborative filtering.
	•	track_ids.npy: Index to song ID mapping.

## 🧪 Recommender Modes


### 1. 🎯 Content-Based

Uses song metadata like tempo, genre, duration, mode, etc.

from content_based import get_content_recommendations
recommendations = get_content_recommendations(song_title)

### 2. 🤝 Collaborative Filtering

Based on user behavior similarity using cosine similarity on sparse matrix.

from collaborative import get_collab_recommendations
recommendations = get_collab_recommendations(song_title)

### 3. 🔁 Hybrid

Combines both approaches with custom weights.

from hybrid import get_hybrid_recommendations
recommendations = get_hybrid_recommendations(song_title)

🖥️ **Streamlit UI Preview**

### 🎛️ User Input Interface

Users can enter a song name and artist name, choose the number of recommendations, and select the diversity level for hybrid mode.

### 🎧 Recommendation Output

After clicking “Get Recommendations”, the app displays:

- 🎵 Currently Playing song  
- 🎶 Next Up tracks with audio previews  
- 📊 A diversity breakdown bar chart

These UI snapshots demonstrate real-time interaction and personalized music recommendations using content-based or hybrid logic.

## ☁️ Deployment Overview

This project is deployed using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline on AWS. The infrastructure and flow include:

- 🚀 **CI/CD via GitHub Actions** – Automates build, test, and deployment steps.
- 📦 **Dockerized Application** – The app is containerized using Docker for consistency across environments.
- 🐳 **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** – Stores and manages the Docker image.
- 📁 **Amazon S3** – Hosts the deployment bundle (`appspec.yml`, shell scripts, etc.) used by CodeDeploy.
- 🤖 **AWS CodeDeploy** – Handles the automated deployment process to the EC2 instance.
- 💻 **EC2 Instance (Ubuntu)** – Runs the production-ready Streamlit app.

> 💡 The deployment is production-grade, enabling seamless updates with each `git push`.

## 🔐 IAM Roles Overview

To enable secure and automated deployment of the Spotify Hybrid Recommender System on AWS, the following IAM roles were configured:

![IAM Roles Summary](assets/iam-roles-summary.png)

## 🪣 S3 Bucket Configuration

This project uses an S3 bucket to store deployment artifacts like deployment.zip used in AWS CodeDeploy.
![S3 bucket](assets/S3 bucket.png)

## 🐳 Amazon ECR – Docker Image

This project uses Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store and manage Docker images for deployment on EC2 via AWS CodeDeploy.
![ECR Image pushed](assets/ECR_Image_pushed.png)

### Key Roles

- **codedeploy-service-role**: Grants AWS CodeDeploy permission to manage deployments across EC2 instances and interact with Auto Scaling.
- **ec2_codedeploy_role**: Allows EC2 instances to access S3 buckets and pull application bundles during deployment.
- **ec2_ecr_role3**: Grants EC2 permission to pull Docker images from Amazon ECR securely.
- **AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling**: Auto-assigned role to manage Auto Scaling operations during blue/green deployments.
- **AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing**: Used for managing load balancer configurations.
- **AWSServiceRoleForSupport / TrustedAdvisor**: Default AWS service-linked roles that enhance infrastructure monitoring.

> 🔒 These roles ensure that deployment workflows via GitHub Actions, CodeDeploy, and Docker containers on EC2 operate securely and with least-privilege access.
